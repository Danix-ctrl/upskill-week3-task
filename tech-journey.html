    <h1>Hello i'm Onuh Daniel </h1>
    <article>
        <p>"Welcome to my website, where I share my tech journey! As an entry-level front-end developer, I’m excited to take you on a memorable exploration of when my journey began. Let’s dive in!"</p>
        <p>It all started when I was a kid. Everything about technology seemed so much fun to me that I spent most of my time trying to figure out how various devices and appliances worked. I also attempted to bring my imagination to life by constructing a few electronic projects. For instance, I built a mini battery-operated fan and a moving car using cotton and a DC fan component.</p>In my final year of high school, while preparing for my O-level exams, I constructed a radio device that could receive low-range signals. That was when I realized I was on the path toward fulfilling my dream.</p>
    <p>I then attended Federal Polytechnic Oko, where I studied computer engineering and earned an OND certificate. In 2018, a friend invited me to the<a href="https://www.genesystechhub.com/" target="_blank"> <em>Genesys Ignite</em> </a>event hosted in Enugu, which I still consider the best tech event I have ever attended. The event inspired me and ignited my tech skills, allowing me to imagine new ways to solve global problems through technology. My passion and admiration for tech soared to new heights, prompting me to apply for the Learnable 2020 program under the product design track. Successfully completing that program was a dream come true for me.</p> 
    <p>Years later, I learned about Web3 and AI automation, which enabled me to work with various tech professionals and brands. I gained more exposure to technology and decided to add more skills to my portfolio. Since it is my passion and dream to become a programmer, I applied to the Upskill program to learn about web development. Now, here I am, using HTML and CSS to design my first web page and share my tech journey.</p>
